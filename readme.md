# Day 39: MarkDown NoteDown ShowDown
Building an app to create markdown friendly notes

## Explorer Mode

Using React, Redux, React Router, and a fresh clone of the webpack starter you will be creating an app that allows users to write up notes in text area in markdown, see a live preview of that note on the same page and finally submit to save the note on the server.

* Your app will use multiple react components to present a text area to the user where they can type a note.
* As the user types into the textarea they should see their markdown code parsed and previewed in a box of the same side on the right hand side of the page.
* When the user hits submit the content should be sent to backendless and saved.
* The notes need to be longer than 50 characters, anything less should not be sent to backendless.
* The user should get confirmation on the page that their post was saved successfully.
* The text area should empty after their post is saved.

### Notes

* To handle the markdown parsing you'll need two things.
    * The marked JS library.
      * Know how to dangerously Set Inner HTML
* Example UI http://markdownlivepreview.com/
    * Yours will obviously look much better than this, but that is the desired layout.

### Adventure Mode

* Write tests for your components and your reducer
* Allow the users to navigate to a page that shows all the existing notes in markdown or in the compiled HTML.

### Epic Mode

* Allow the users to edit previously created notes.
